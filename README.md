This project contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) exercises of 2025.

See [the Advent of Code Website](https://adventofcode.com) for more Information about Advent of Code.

All solutions are written in rust.

To run the code you will need to place your input for day x in the file day/dayx/input.txt

Currently the implementations for day2 and day5 part2 are wrong.
